        <h3>About Pole Vaulting</h3>
        <p>Pole vaulting is a track and field event where athletes use a pole to jump over a high bar. It combines strength, technique, and agility, requiring athletes to master the pole's use while also timing their takeoff and release. Pole vaulting is one of the most challenging events in track and field, as it demands both explosive power and refined technique.</p>
